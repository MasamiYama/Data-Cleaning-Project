The script does:
1. Check and download the file (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) as "Coursera_Data_Cleaning.zip"
  if the file has not been downloaded.
2. Check and unzip the file if UCI HAR Dataset folder does not exist
3. Create multiple data frames
Variable name
features from features list
activities from activity_labels.txt
subject_test from subject_test.txt
subject_train from subject_train.txt
x_test from X_test.txt for test data set
y_test from y_test.txt for test labels
x_train fron X_train.txt for training data set
y_train fron y_train.txt for training labels

4. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
X is from x_test and x_train
Labels is from y_test and y_train
SUBJ is from subject_test and subject_train)
data is from SUBJ, Labels and X

5. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
meanandstd is created from data and subject, code and columns containing "mean" and "std"

6. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Replaced meanandstd$code with activity names

7. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
Replaced "Acc" with "Accelerometer"
Replaced "Gyro" with "Gyroscope")
Replaced "BodyBody" with "Body"
Replaced "Mag" with "Magnitude"
Replaced "t" with "Time"
Replaced "f" with "Frequency"
Replaced "tBody" with "TimeBody")
Replaced "-std()" with "Standard"
Replaced "-freq()" with "Frequency"

8. From the data set in step 4., create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
  for each activity and each subject
tidyData is a new data set for this.
